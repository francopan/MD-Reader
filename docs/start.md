#Start File

Insert the files inside the *docs* folder.
Then, list them down here:

* File 1
* File 2
* File 3

I'm still into listing up all the files dinamically, but I wanted this to be a pure front end app.

I looked up the filesystem API, but is deprecated. If you know how to do it, make a pull request. :)

This app uses Showdownjs: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown

Feel free to modify and distribute the code made by me.

Look up the *license.txt* for the Showdown and Markdown license.
