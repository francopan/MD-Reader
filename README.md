# MD-Reader

MD-Reader is a front-end 'plug-and-play' viewer/organizer of markdown documents. Just place the *md* files inside the *docs* folder.

**What it does now?**

* It reads the contents of .md files and converts it to html (thanks to Showdown: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)
* Automaticaly creates a summary/table of contents for the documents.

**What's up next?**
* Search directory to list up all .md files
* Search inside the files

**Also**

Look up the *license.txt* for the Showdown and Markdown license.
